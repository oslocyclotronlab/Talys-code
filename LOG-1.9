Development of TALYS since release of TALYS-1.8

- December 28, 2015

********** Release of TALYS-1.8 **********

- January 21, 2016

Dimitri Rochman managed to crash TALYS, a rare feat indeed!
For ldmodel 6, it was possible to have an undefined value for D0,
leading to possible incident energies of 0 MeV, which crashes ECIS.
Therefore a minimum value for eninclow, 1.e-11 MeV, was set in grid.f

- February 12, 2016

Solved an error found by Vlad Avrigeanu. Contrary to what is stated in the manual, 
alphaomp was NOT yet the default in TALYS-1.8. To use the best alpha OMP, you
have to explicitly put alphaomp 6.
This is solved now in input4.f

- June 1, 2016

Implemented the possibility to read external files for M1 strength functions, 
and also the possibility to scale them with the etable and ftable keywords.
Changes were suggested by Stephane Goriely. etable and ftable are now extended,
e.g. etable 40 93 1.2 M1
A new keyword m1file was introduced.

- June 2, 2016

Replace RECENT, SIGMA1 and GROUPIE subroutines of PREPRO-2013 to PREPRO-2015.

- July 9, 2016

Revised Kalbach parametrization for break up reactions, according to the latest draft of her Phys Rev C paper.

- July 16, 2016

Added keyword massdir to add your own masstables to the talys/structure/mass/ directory

- September 7, 2016

Corrected an error in the deformed OMP for actinides of Soukhovitskii et al, after a problem was
reported by Fabio Zeisler. The Fermi energy in the OMP definition was taken from the global KD03 formula,
while the Soukhovitskii OMP uses specific Fermi energies per nucleus.

- September 19, 2016

Corrected an error found by Bernard Erasmus: medical isotope production
Results were different for a second run in which the TALYS results were already 
precalculated. Solved this by initializing the discrete levels for non-binary channels
(this was omitted when 'reaction n').

- November 2, 2016

Stephane Goriely added 2 new keywords upbendc and upbende to adjust gamma-ray strength functions at low energy.

- November 8, 2016

Stephane Goriely added 2 new keywords astroex and nonthermlev to account for cross sections to excited states.
To accommodate this I introduced variables MaxZastro and MaxNastro to keep the memory for astro arrays
under control.

- November 16, 2016

Solved a problem for low lying 0+ states. ECIS seems to produce inelastic cross sections larger than
the  reaction cross section. In case of a weakcoupling model, if the first discrete level is a 0+
we replace it by 2+.

- November 28, 2016

Added a loop over astrophysical temperatures in resonance.f. Low energy resonance capture is now
broadened by prepro at various temperatures to obtained physically more realistic reaction rates.

- December 8, 2016

Introduced the trim() option everywhere for characters so the length of pathnames no longer needs to
be recorded, a nasty F77 feature.

- December 15, 2016

Added p-wave radiative width and D1, on the advice of Stephane Goriely.

- March 12 2017

Renamed the files of the entire structure/ directory. Instead of using e.g. z010.dat it is now called 
Ne.lev for the discrete levels (Ne for the element, .lev for the extension) and similarly in all other databases.
The filenaming is now consistent all over the TALYS code and its satellite codes.

- April 3, 2017

Improved the output of isomeric fission yield ratios, on the advice of Satoshi Chiba.

- May 3, 2017

Repaired a bug found by Ann-Cecilie Larsen and solved by Stephan Goriely on equidistant 
energy grid in astrophysical calculations in partfunc.f

- May 5, 2017

Must repair bug found by Dmitry Smychko: adopt ENDSF suggested spin in all cases
Must repair bug found by Steven Gardiner: K39 has even spin levels, maybe more general problem

- September 22, 2017

Separated quasi-deuteron calculation in separate subroutine

- November 11, 2017

Replaced PREPRO subroutines by 2017 versions.

TODO

Error in discrete level file, K39 has even spins!
Also print negative parity in population, email from Yi Xu, March 2016
optmodall y problem of Ch Wei
Add units to the various output files
use tabulated temperature in strength.f to remove level density
inconsistency.
Add logarithmic incident energy grid
MSD/MSC
Junghans parameterization for gamma strength functions
Investigate option J=0,numJ,Jstep as suggested by Roberto
Investigate option to disable widthfluc if compelastic small
Change default for Cbreak for alpha-induced, see emails of Spyrou and Goriely
(problems near threshold)
Change default for JLM: if jlmomp y then force spherical y
g + N14 file gives Infinity (Igor Rakhno)
