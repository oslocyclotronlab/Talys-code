# Talys-code
This repository is created to store the source code of the TALYS package. Since the creators of the package does not provide any bug-tracker, change history, etc., we will have a private repository to keep track of changes here. If you recive a 'bug-fix' or similar, please create a new branch and add the change there. That way we might be able to keep track of what is fixed, what has been changed etc. Also, we should use the bug-tracker when anyone finds a bug. Currently the default branch is the 'newest' 1.9 version with one or more bugfixes. Please add earlier versions such as 1.8 in new branches.

### Note: I have not included the database part of the package as that is a huge package of data.
